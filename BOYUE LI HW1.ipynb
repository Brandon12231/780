        "\n",
        "There are two types of models in Pyomo: concrete and abstract. The former can be created when all your data elements (constraint parameters and objective coefficients) are available at the time of model creation. The abstract model allows us to create a model without \"hard coding\" data as part of it. The former is easier (hence we use it here). The latter allows us to separately specify a data file whose content will decide the model details. Abstract model is more common in some of the more popular optimization modeling languages (such as AMPL), as it allows us to focus on the type of model, without getting bogged down in the details of a specific instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having said that, because Pyomo is being used within Python, we could achieve quite a bit of \"program--data separation\" using a concrete model too. We use ConcreteModel in this example since it's a little easier to use.\n",
